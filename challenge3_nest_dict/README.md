## Challenge:

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value

Example:
```
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
```

### Approach

Due to time limitations I will be using a python library called munch (pip install munch)
